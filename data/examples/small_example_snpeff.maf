In this case report, a patient with metastatic, ALK-rearranged NSCLC with C1156Y mutation had tumor progression under sequential treatment with first crizotinib, then ceritinib and finally AUY922. Subsequent chemotherapy (carboplatin–pemetrexed) was administered and the patient had a response for 6 months before progression. Exome sequencing revealed the C1156Y mutation was present in <7% of the pretreatment tumor and in ~50% of the crizotinib tumor prior to ceritinib therapy.|Case report of a patient with metastatic ALK-rearranged NSCLC after progression under sequential crizotinib, ceritinib, HSP90 inhibitor AUY922 and chemotherapy followed by crizotinib again. Third generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib led to a partial response that lasted for 8 months. The C1156Y mutation was confirmed in a sample prior to initial crizotinib (<7% of cells), following crizotinib treatment (~50% of cells) and following lorlatinib resistance (100% of cells). However, a second ALK mutation (C1156Y & L1198F) was detected in the lorlatinib resistant tumor.|EML4-ALK variant 3 containing NSCLC cell line H2228 xenografts in SCID beige mice were treated with increasing doses of crizotinib up to 100 mg/kg per day by oral gavage. At approximately 40 days tumors progressed. 80 progressed tumors were tested for ALK mutations, and 6 mutant ALK variants were found. Two of the mutations were at ALK C1156Y. In Ba/F3 cells, EML4-ALK variant 3 with C1156Y was introduced and tested for crizotinib sensitivity. Survival IC50 value of 177 nM was reported, which is 9.3 times the IC50 reported for crizotinib in EML4-ALK wild-type Ba/F3 cells.&.&.&.	26698910|26698910|24675041&.&.&.	ALK amplifications, fusions and mutations have been shown to be driving events in non-small cell lung cancer. While crizontinib has demonstrated efficacy in treating the amplification, mutations in ALK have been shown to confer resistance to current tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Second-generation TKI's have seen varied success in treating these resistant cases, and the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG has been shown to be cytostatic in ALK-altered cell lines.&.&.&.

All mutations were compared with non-mutated BCR-ABL protein and were grouped according to their anti-proliferative activity. Mutant cell lines that exhibited a greater than 4-fold increase in IC50 value were considered resistant to drug, 2-4 fold increase in IC50 were moderately resistant and less than 2-fold change in IC50 was sensitive to drug treatment. The E255K mutation was resistant to imatinib.|A panel of 16 mutations seen in imatinib CML patents were used to evaluate the effectiveness of drug binding. All mutations were compared with non-mutated BCR-ABL protein and evaluated for anti-proliferative activity and substrate or auto-phosphorylation assays. The E255K mutation was resistant to imatinib (20-fold IC50 increase for the proliferation assay).|In an in vitro study, Ba/F3 cell line stably expressing the E255K mutation in the ABL1 portion of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein was associated with resistance to nilotinib treatment (IC50: 6.69-fold), as compared to Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL1 fusion protein (reported to be sensitizing to nilotinib). Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell proliferation.|This was a retrospective study of dasatinib and/or nilotinib-resistant or -intolerant patients pretreated with imatinib aimed at evaluating the efficacy of bosutanib monotherapy. All patients had chronic phase CML and BCR-ABL fusions. Complete hematologic response (CHR) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR) were comparable for patients with Abl1 mutation versus without. Of patients with E255K, 0/1 had a CHR and 0/1 had a MCyR. Nine patients in this study had multiple kinase domain mutations, but it was not indicated when mutations were co-occuring.|In this retrospective study, imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients, with chronic phase CML and BCR-ABL fusions, were treated with bosutanib monotherapy. Complete hematologic response (CHR) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR) were comparable for patients with Abl1 mutation versus without. The authors conclude that bosutanib is effective across all BCR-ABL mutations observed except T315I. Of patients with E255K evaluated, 2/2 had complete hematologic responses and 1/2 had a major cytogenetic response.|This is a retrospective study of imatinib-resistant (n = 805) or -intolerant (n = 238), chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic-phase), patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL gene fusion kinase domain from the START-C, START-R, and CA180-034 trials. With dasatinib monotherapy, patients with and without ABL1 mutation  had comparable complete hematologic response (CHR), major cytogenetic response (MCyR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and major molecular response (MMR). Out of 16 patients with E255K mutations, 6, 9, and 14 achieved CCyR, MCyR, and CHR with dasatinib monotherapy, respectively. Analyses by variant included patients with multiple kinase domain mutations.|In this phase II multinational study, patients with accelerated phase CML and BCR-ABL fusions were treated with dasatinib monotherapy. Response rate among 60 imatinib-resistant patients with BCR-ABL mutations did not differ from the rate of the total population of 100 imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients. 44 (73%) of 60 BCR-ABL mutant patients achieved major hematologic responses (MaHRs) and 18 (30%) of 60 achieved major cytogenetic responses (MCyRs). Of patients with E255K, 4/6 had MaHRs which was comparable to response rates among wild type patients, and 0/6 had MCyRs which was lower than response rates among wild type patients.|In an in vitro study, stochastic mutations in the ABL1 region of the p210 BCR-ABL fusion were generated and stably expressed in Ba/F3 cell lines from mutagenized libraries. Combination therapy with 10﻿ μM imatinib and 50 nM Dasatinib resulted in 11 clones, 5 of which had the E255K variant.|In an in vitro study, stochastic mutations were introduced into the ABL1 region of a stably expressed p210 BCR-ABL fusion in Ba/F3 cells using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis. The E255V mutation was associated with resistance in 4 μM imatinib ( 1 clone, 0.43%) and 500 nM nilotinib (1 clone, 1.25%) tyrosine kinase inhibitors.|In an in vitro study, stochastic mutations in the ABL1 region of a stably expressed p210 BCR-ABL fusion were generated in Ba/F3 cell lines from five independently derived, mutagenized libraries. Dasatinib resistant subclones were identified using ﻿50 nM dasatinib in liquid culture. 201 individual clones were identified representing 10 different mutations at 6 different residues. 4 of these clones had E255K mutations. To validate resistance to dasatinib, a Ba/F3 cell line stably expressing the E255K mutation in the ABL1 region of the BCR-ABL fusion was generated. The E255K variants was associated with higher dasatinib IC50 of 13 nM vs 1.34 nM in wildtype and higher imatinib IC50 of 8,400 nM vs 323 nM in wildtype as determined by dose response curves.|In this open-label, phase II registration trial, patients that were imatinib resistant or intolerant underwent nilotinib monotherapy. Within 12 months of nilotinib therapy, there was no significant difference in response to nilotinib treatment between patients with mutations in the Abl1 kinase domain versus without. However, the authors identify Y253H, E255K/V, and F359C/V variants as resistant as they had an IC50 greater than 150 nM. In patients with E255K and/or E255V mutations prior to nilotinib treatment, complete hematological responses were achieved in 5 of 7 patients, major cytogenetic responses in 3 of 7 patients, complete cytogenetic responses in 0 of 7 patients, and a major molecular response in 1 of 7 patients. After a median follow-up of 15.5 months, 6 of 7 patients with this mutation progressed or died. The E255K mutation was present in 6 patients at baseline and newly emerged in 4 patients at progression. The E255V mutation was present in 0 patients at baseline and newly emerged in 3 patients at progression.|In an in vitro study, stochastic mutations were introduced into the ABL1 region of a stably expressed p210 BCR-ABL fusion in Ba/F3 cells using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis. Resulting clones were grown in a range of tyrosine kinase inhibitor concentrations to identify resistance mutations. The E255K mutation was associated with resistance in 16 μM imatinib ( 1 clone recovered, ~3%) and all lower concentrations as well as in 50 nM nilotinib (5 clones, ~11%) and 5 nM dasatinib (2 clones, ~6%), the lowest concentrations tested for these two drugs. In a review of 20 publications, this mutation was described in imatinib resistant patients.|In a study of 39 chronic phase CML patients with BCR-ABL variants, E255K was seen in a single imatinib-resistant patient that was also resistant or intolerant to dasatinib and/or nilotinib treatment.

Cells harboring this fusion have shown sensitivity to imatinib, greatly improving the prognostic outlook of the disease. However, additional mutations in ABL1 have been shown to confer resistance to imatinib. In these resistance cases, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib have exhibited some efficacy and are currently undergoing clinical trials for treating acquired resistance in CML.

We performed a multihistology basket study of AZD5363. 58 patients with advanced solid tumors were treated. In patients with AKT1 E17K-mutant tumors (n = 52) and a median of 5 lines of prior therapy, the median PFS was 5.5 months , 6.6 months and 4.2 months in patients with ER+ breast, gynecologic, and other solid tumors, respectively. In an exploratory biomarker analysis, imbalance of the AKT1 E17K-mutant allele, most frequently caused by copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity targeting the wild-type allele, was associated with longer PFS as was the presence of coincident PI3K pathway hotspot mutations. Persistent declines in AKT1 E17K in cfDNA were associated with improved PFS and response. Responses were not restricted to patients with detectable AKT1 E17K in pretreatment cfDNA.|In an in vitro study, a M229 cell line endogenously expressing BRAF V600E mutation (a known vemurafenib sensitizing mutation) and overexpressing AKT1 E17K mutation was associated with resistance to vemurafenib treatment, as compared to cells expressing BRAF V600E mutation and wildtype AKT1.
