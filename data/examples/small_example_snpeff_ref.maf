In this case report, a patient with metastatic, ALK-rearranged NSCLC with C1156Y mutation had tumor progression under sequential treatment with first crizotinib, then ceritinib and finally AUY922. Subsequent chemotherapy (carboplatin–pemetrexed) was administered and the patient had a response for 6 months before progression. Exome sequencing revealed the C1156Y mutation was present in <7% of the pretreatment tumor and in ~50% of the crizotinib tumor prior to ceritinib therapy.|Case report of a patient with metastatic ALK-rearranged NSCLC after progression under sequential crizotinib, ceritinib, HSP90 inhibitor AUY922 and chemotherapy followed by crizotinib again. Third generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib led to a partial response that lasted for 8 months. The C1156Y mutation was confirmed in a sample prior to initial crizotinib (<7% of cells), following crizotinib treatment (~50% of cells) and following lorlatinib resistance (100% of cells). However, a second ALK mutation (C1156Y & L1198F) was detected in the lorlatinib resistant tumor.|EML4-ALK variant 3 containing NSCLC cell line H2228 xenografts in SCID beige mice were treated with increasing doses of crizotinib up to 100 mg/kg per day by oral gavage. At approximately 40 days tumors progressed. 80 progressed tumors were tested for ALK mutations, and 6 mutant ALK variants were found. Two of the mutations were at ALK C1156Y. In Ba/F3 cells, EML4-ALK variant 3 with C1156Y was introduced and tested for crizotinib sensitivity. Survival IC50 value of 177 nM was reported, which is 9.3 times the IC50 reported for crizotinib in EML4-ALK wild-type Ba/F3 cells.&.&.&.	26698910|26698910|24675041&.&.&.	ALK amplifications, fusions and mutations have been shown to be driving events in non-small cell lung cancer. While crizontinib has demonstrated efficacy in treating the amplification, mutations in ALK have been shown to confer resistance to current tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Second-generation TKI's have seen varied success in treating these resistant cases, and the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG has been shown to be cytostatic in ALK-altered cell lines.&.&.&.	.	0	1057519859	1	GT:PS:DP:ADALL:AD:GQ	1/1:.:183:0,63:0,0:302

All mutations were compared with non-mutated BCR-ABL protein and were grouped according to their anti-proliferative activity. Mutant cell lines that exhibited a greater than 4-fold increase in IC50 value were considered resistant to drug, 2-4 fold increase in IC50 were moderately resistant and less than 2-fold change in IC50 was sensitive to drug treatment. The E255K mutation was resistant to imatinib.|A panel of 16 mutations seen in imatinib CML patents were used to evaluate the effectiveness of drug binding. All mutations were compared with non-mutated BCR-ABL protein and evaluated for anti-proliferative activity and substrate or auto-phosphorylation assays. The E255K mutation was resistant to imatinib (20-fold IC50 increase for the proliferation assay).|In an in vitro study, Ba/F3 cell line stably expressing the E255K mutation in the ABL1 portion of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein was associated with resistance to nilotinib treatment (IC50: 6.69-fold), as compared to Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL1 fusion protein (reported to be sensitizing to nilotinib). Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell proliferation.|This was a retrospective study of dasatinib and/or nilotinib-resistant or -intolerant patients pretreated with imatinib aimed at evaluating the efficacy of bosutanib monotherapy. All patients had chronic phase CML and BCR-ABL fusions. Complete hematologic response (CHR) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR) were comparable for patients with Abl1 mutation versus without. Of patients with E255K, 0/1 had a CHR and 0/1 had a MCyR. Nine patients in this study had multiple kinase domain mutations, but it was not indicated when mutations were co-occuring.|In this retrospective study, imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients, with chronic phase CML and BCR-ABL fusions, were treated with bosutanib monotherapy. Complete hematologic response (CHR) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR) were comparable for patients with Abl1 mutation versus without. The authors conclude that bosutanib is effective across all BCR-ABL mutations observed except T315I. Of patients with E255K evaluated, 2/2 had complete hematologic responses and 1/2 had a major cytogenetic response.|This is a retrospective study of imatinib-resistant (n = 805) or -intolerant (n = 238), chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic-phase), patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL gene fusion kinase domain from the START-C, START-R, and CA180-034 trials. With dasatinib monotherapy, patients with and without ABL1 mutation  had comparable complete hematologic response (CHR), major cytogenetic response (MCyR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and major molecular response (MMR). Out of 16 patients with E255K mutations, 6, 9, and 14 achieved CCyR, MCyR, and CHR with dasatinib monotherapy, respectively. Analyses by variant included patients with multiple kinase domain mutations.|In this phase II multinational study, patients with accelerated phase CML and BCR-ABL fusions were treated with dasatinib monotherapy. Response rate among 60 imatinib-resistant patients with BCR-ABL mutations did not differ from the rate of the total population of 100 imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients. 44 (73%) of 60 BCR-ABL mutant patients achieved major hematologic responses (MaHRs) and 18 (30%) of 60 achieved major cytogenetic responses (MCyRs). Of patients with E255K, 4/6 had MaHRs which was comparable to response rates among wild type patients, and 0/6 had MCyRs which was lower than response rates among wild type patients.|In an in vitro study, stochastic mutations in the ABL1 region of the p210 BCR-ABL fusion were generated and stably expressed in Ba/F3 cell lines from mutagenized libraries. Combination therapy with 10﻿ μM imatinib and 50 nM Dasatinib resulted in 11 clones, 5 of which had the E255K variant.|In an in vitro study, stochastic mutations were introduced into the ABL1 region of a stably expressed p210 BCR-ABL fusion in Ba/F3 cells using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis. The E255V mutation was associated with resistance in 4 μM imatinib ( 1 clone, 0.43%) and 500 nM nilotinib (1 clone, 1.25%) tyrosine kinase inhibitors.|In an in vitro study, stochastic mutations in the ABL1 region of a stably expressed p210 BCR-ABL fusion were generated in Ba/F3 cell lines from five independently derived, mutagenized libraries. Dasatinib resistant subclones were identified using ﻿50 nM dasatinib in liquid culture. 201 individual clones were identified representing 10 different mutations at 6 different residues. 4 of these clones had E255K mutations. To validate resistance to dasatinib, a Ba/F3 cell line stably expressing the E255K mutation in the ABL1 region of the BCR-ABL fusion was generated. The E255K variants was associated with higher dasatinib IC50 of 13 nM vs 1.34 nM in wildtype and higher imatinib IC50 of 8,400 nM vs 323 nM in wildtype as determined by dose response curves.|In this open-label, phase II registration trial, patients that were imatinib resistant or intolerant underwent nilotinib monotherapy. Within 12 months of nilotinib therapy, there was no significant difference in response to nilotinib treatment between patients with mutations in the Abl1 kinase domain versus without. However, the authors identify Y253H, E255K/V, and F359C/V variants as resistant as they had an IC50 greater than 150 nM. In patients with E255K and/or E255V mutations prior to nilotinib treatment, complete hematological responses were achieved in 5 of 7 patients, major cytogenetic responses in 3 of 7 patients, complete cytogenetic responses in 0 of 7 patients, and a major molecular response in 1 of 7 patients. After a median follow-up of 15.5 months, 6 of 7 patients with this mutation progressed or died. The E255K mutation was present in 6 patients at baseline and newly emerged in 4 patients at progression. The E255V mutation was present in 0 patients at baseline and newly emerged in 3 patients at progression.|In an in vitro study, stochastic mutations were introduced into the ABL1 region of a stably expressed p210 BCR-ABL fusion in Ba/F3 cells using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis. Resulting clones were grown in a range of tyrosine kinase inhibitor concentrations to identify resistance mutations. The E255K mutation was associated with resistance in 16 μM imatinib ( 1 clone recovered, ~3%) and all lower concentrations as well as in 50 nM nilotinib (5 clones, ~11%) and 5 nM dasatinib (2 clones, ~6%), the lowest concentrations tested for these two drugs. In a review of 20 publications, this mutation was described in imatinib resistant patients.|In a study of 39 chronic phase CML patients with BCR-ABL variants, E255K was seen in a single imatinib-resistant patient that was also resistant or intolerant to dasatinib and/or nilotinib treatment. Nine patients in this study had multiple kinase domain mutations, but it was not indicated when mutations were co-occurring.|In a phase II study of 60 imatinib-resistant patients with BCR-ABL mutations, 6 had E255K mutations	.&.&.&.&15194504|19075254|15930265|19075254|22371878|21865346|19779040|17264298|15705718|16772610|15705718|19652056|16772610|22371878|17264298	.&.&.&.&ABL1 is most relevant to cancer in its role in the BCR-ABL fusion protein that has become a signature of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Cells harboring this fusion have shown sensitivity to imatinib, greatly improving the prognostic outlook of the disease. However, additional mutations in ABL1 have been shown to confer resistance to imatinib. In these resistance cases, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib have exhibited some efficacy and are currently undergoing clinical trials for treating acquired resistance in CML.	.	3	121913448	1	GT:PS:DP:ADALL:AD:GQ	1/1:.:183:0,63:0,0:302

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a single cohort of colorectal patients with G12D mutations. Overall, the interpretation for KRAS mutations in most clinical scenarios is still undecided.|While the KRAS G12 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still actively debated.

Mutant KRAS was observed in 265 (31.5%) cases and 90 of these were G12V. Patients with KRAS G12V exhibited worse OS and TTR compared with the entire cohort. These results were confirmed using multivariate analyses (non-G12V status, hazard ratio (HR): 0.43 (confidence interval: 0.28–0.65), P<0.0001 for OS. Risk of recurrence was significantly lower for non-KRAS G12V (HR: 0.01, (0.001–0.08), P<0.0001).|83 patients from a phase II trial (docetaxel + placebo or selumetinib) with KRAS mutant tumors were retrospectively assessed for differences in OS, PFS, ORR and change in tumor size at week 6 according to type of KRAS mutation. G12C, G12D and G12V were the most common mutations (46%, 22%, 11%, respectively). Patients with G12C or G12V mutations had a trend towards longer OS, PFS and ORR compared to other KRAS mutations. Changes in tumor size were similar between groups with the best responses in tumors with G12V mutations. Few differences were observed between groups when treated with docetaxel + placebo.|Case report of a 59-year-old white female patient (60 pack-years) with a CUP-syndrome. Molecular profiling identified both MET amplification (16 copies) and a KRAS G12V mutation.

Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability.|In this study, a large cohort of metastatic colorectal cancer patients were treated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab or panitumumab). KRAS, PIK3CA, and PTEN were tested for mutation; KRAS G12V was the only variant noted in the primary rectal tumor of one patient who experienced disease progression (patient 56; Supplemental Table 1), and the primary colon tumors of two patients (9, 13; Supplemental Table 1) who experienced stable disease following treatment. In the larger cohort, patients with tumors harboring any KRAS mutation had significantly decreased incidence of objective response than patients with wtKRAS tumors.

Additionally, KRAS mutations combined with CDKN2A alterations (N=26) showed an even worse OS than those wild-type for both (N=17; HR: 95%CI 1.33-7.10).|One patient enrolled in a clinical study to evaluate vemurafenib treatment of BRAF V600E mutant hairy-cell leukemia developed resistance to vemurafenib retreatment. 300-gene targeted sequencing of the patient’s genome revealed activating subclonal KRAS mutations (KRAS G12D, 15.2% allele frequency; KRAS K117N, 1.2%), as well as a RUNX1 A55E mutation (5.9%) that had not been seen prior to vemurafenib treatment or at remission. BRAF V600E allele frequency was detectable (2.4%) at the time of remission but dramatically increased at relapse (64.9%).|Exon-2 KRAS mutation status was analyzed in 219 patients with pancreatic ductal carcinoma, excluding those who had previously undergone chemotherapy, first-line pancreatic resection, or neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. 72 patients had wild-type KRAS, 147 had a codon-12 KRAS mutation (G12D, G12V, or G12R) and 73 had a G12D KRAS mutation, specifically. There was no significant difference in overall survival between wild-type patients and patients with any type of exon-12 mutation. However, patients with the G12D mutation exhibited significantly lower overall survival compared to wild-type patients in univariate and multivariate analyses. This difference in overall survival between wild-type and G12D patients persisted in the subset of patients who underwent chemotherapy at any point after enrollment.|A patient with metastatic colorectal cancer was enrolled in a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT01174121). 24 cultures of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were expanded from 3 lung metastasis resections. After cultures were tested for reactivity, the patient was infused with 1.48 x 10^11 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (75% CD8+ T cells) that were specifically reactive to KRAS G12D.

Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic.

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a single cohort of colorectal patients with G12D mutations. Overall, the interpretation for KRAS mutations in most clinical scenarios is still undecided.|While the KRAS G12 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still actively debated.

Cells harboring KRAS G12V mutation were insensitive to cetuximab treatment in isogenic SW48 cells and in a mouse xenograft model.|In vivo studies confirmed the activity of PD0332991 (CDK4 inhibitor) on KRAS G12V mutant tumors. 17% (2/12) of mice treated with PD0332991 developed detectable lesions, whereas 75% of mice (3/4) treated with vehicle developed lesions at the end of the treatment.|Retrospective analysis of data from 841 patients who underwent surgery and molecular testing for NSCLC.  Mutant KRAS was observed in 265 (31.5%) cases and 90 of these were G12V. Patients with KRAS G12V exhibited worse OS and TTR compared with the entire cohort. These results were confirmed using multivariate analyses (non-G12V status, hazard ratio (HR): 0.43 (confidence interval: 0.28–0.65), P<0.0001 for OS. Risk of recurrence was significantly lower for non-KRAS G12V (HR: 0.01, (0.001–0.08), P<0.0001).|83 patients from a phase II trial (docetaxel + placebo or selumetinib) with KRAS mutant tumors were retrospectively assessed for differences in OS, PFS, ORR and change in tumor size at week 6 according to type of KRAS mutation. G12C, G12D and G12V were the most common mutations (46%, 22%, 11%, respectively). Patients with G12C or G12V mutations had a trend towards longer OS, PFS and ORR compared to other KRAS mutations. Changes in tumor size were similar between groups with the best responses in tumors with G12V mutations. Few differences were observed between groups when treated with docetaxel + placebo.|Case report of a 59-year-old white female patient (60 pack-years) with a CUP-syndrome. Molecular profiling identified both MET amplification (16 copies) and a KRAS G12V mutation. The patient was treated with crizotinib and experienced a complete normalization of tumor metabolic activity for more than 19 months. Other identified aberrations include CCND1 amplification (8 copies), MYC amplification (9 copies) as well as KRAS G12V, TP53 R273L and CARD11 N184S.|In 28 out of 40 (70%) metastatic colorectal cancer tumors harboring KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, or PIK3CA mutations and implanted into mice, the therapeutic combination of the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 and the PI3K/mTor inhibitor BEZ235 resulted in disease stabilization. Mean tumor growth was lower in the tumors treated with AZD6244+ BEZ235 (+77% vs. +267%, P=1E-6) compared to AZD6244 alone and (+77% vs. +222%, P=0.0014) BEZ235 alone. 32/40 tumors harbored KRAS mutations including 8 G12V mutations (3 with PIK3CA mutations) where progressive disease occurred in only 1 tumor upon doublet treatment but 6 tumors in monotherapy.|In a retrospective study of 427 metastatic colorectal patients, KRAS mutations were observed in 43% of the tumor samples. Patients with mutations in codon 12 or 13 of KRAS were associated with reduced response to panitumumab compared to wildtype KRAS (HR:0.99, 95% CI:0.73-1.36 vs. HR:0.45, 95% CI:0.34-0.59; P<0.0001). Additionally, patients with KRAS mutations showed no significant improvement between treatment with panitumumab and best supportive care alone (PFS: 7.4 wk vs 7.3 wk).|In recurrent lung cancer patients treated with the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib, patients with KRAS mutations had a lower frequency of partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) and a higher rate of progressive disease (PD) (PR:0, SD:1, PD:15 vs. PR:24, SD:8, PD:14; P=0.0274) compared to wildtype KRAS patients. Patients with KRAS mutations also had a shorter overall survival compared to wildtype KRAS patients (HR:2.542, 95% CI:1.048-6.168, P=0.0390).|In an in vitro study,  a SW48 cell line expressing KRAS G12V mutation demonstrated decreased sensitivity  to regorafenib treatment (IC50: 241.90 nmol vs. 114.28 nmol, P<0.01) compared to SW48 cells expressing KRAS wild-type. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability.|In this study, a large cohort of metastatic colorectal cancer patients were treated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab or panitumumab). KRAS, PIK3CA, and PTEN were tested for mutation; KRAS G12V was the only variant noted in the primary rectal tumor of one patient who experienced disease progression (patient 56; Supplemental Table 1), and the primary colon tumors of two patients (9, 13; Supplemental Table 1) who experienced stable disease following treatment. In the larger cohort, patients with tumors harboring any KRAS mutation had significantly decreased incidence of objective response than patients with wtKRAS tumors. Authors noted that patients with tumors harboring KRAS mutations tended to have decreased PFS and OS compared to those with wild-type tumors though the differences were not statistically significant.&KRAS G12D mutation occurs in never smokers significantly more often than in smokers.|The use of NVP-BEZ235 in conjunction with ARRY-142886, but not as monotherapy, in a lung cancer model with KRAS G12D mutation led to marked tumor regression.|Among 33 patients treated with pan-AKT inhibitor MK-2206 in this phase 1 study, one patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and PTEN loss and a KRAS G12D mutation experienced a decrease of approximately 60% in cancer antigen 19-9 levels and 23% shrinkage in tumor measurements.|In 119 metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with cetuximab-based first-line chemotherapy, KRAS G12D mutations (N=44) were associated with longer overall patient survival when compared to other KRAS G12 mutations (23.3 vs 14-18 months; G12V, A, C, S, R).|In 219 patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, a multivariate analysis identified KRAS G12D mutations as an independent predictor of poorer prognosis both in patients that have received chemotherapy (N=49/162), and the entire series (N=73/219). HR of 1.84 (P=0.02) and 1.44 (P=0.01), respectively.|In 171 patients with tumors of the exocrine pancreas, a KRAS G12D mutation (N=60) was associated with shorter overall survival than being wild-type for KRAS (N=21; Hazard Ratio: 95% CI between 1.14 and 2.67). Additionally, KRAS mutations combined with CDKN2A alterations (N=26) showed an even worse OS than those wild-type for both (N=17; HR: 95%CI 1.33-7.10).|One patient enrolled in a clinical study to evaluate vemurafenib treatment of BRAF V600E mutant hairy-cell leukemia developed resistance to vemurafenib retreatment. 300-gene targeted sequencing of the patient’s genome revealed activating subclonal KRAS mutations (KRAS G12D, 15.2% allele frequency; KRAS K117N, 1.2%), as well as a RUNX1 A55E mutation (5.9%) that had not been seen prior to vemurafenib treatment or at remission. BRAF V600E allele frequency was detectable (2.4%) at the time of remission but dramatically increased at relapse (64.9%).|Exon-2 KRAS mutation status was analyzed in 219 patients with pancreatic ductal carcinoma, excluding those who had previously undergone chemotherapy, first-line pancreatic resection, or neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. 72 patients had wild-type KRAS, 147 had a codon-12 KRAS mutation (G12D, G12V, or G12R) and 73 had a G12D KRAS mutation, specifically. There was no significant difference in overall survival between wild-type patients and patients with any type of exon-12 mutation. However, patients with the G12D mutation exhibited significantly lower overall survival compared to wild-type patients in univariate and multivariate analyses. This difference in overall survival between wild-type and G12D patients persisted in the subset of patients who underwent chemotherapy at any point after enrollment.|A patient with metastatic colorectal cancer was enrolled in a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT01174121). 24 cultures of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were expanded from 3 lung metastasis resections. After cultures were tested for reactivity, the patient was infused with 1.48 x 10^11 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (75% CD8+ T cells) that were specifically reactive to KRAS G12D. All 7 metastatic lung lesions regressed 40 days after therapy, and the patient had a 9-month partial response.|In 28 out of 40 (70%) metastatic colorectal cancer tumors harboring KRAS, NRAS, BRAF or PIK3CA mutations and implanted into mice, the therapeutic combination of the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 and the PI3K/mTor inhibitor BEZ235 resulted in disease stabilization. Mean tumor growth was lower in the tumors treated with AZD6244+ BEZ235 (+77% vs. +267%, P=1E-6) compared to AZD6244 alone and (+77% vs. +222%, P=0.0014) BEZ235 alone. 32/40 tumors studied had KRAS mutations with 9 G12D (2 with PIK3CA H1047R) and 13 other G12 mutations.|In a retrospective study of 427 metastatic colorectal patients, KRAS mutations were observed in 43% of the tumor samples.

Mutations in the RAS family of proteins are frequently observed across cancer types. The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.&Mutations in the RAS family of proteins are frequently observed across cancer types.

We performed a multihistology basket study of AZD5363. 58 patients with advanced solid tumors were treated. In patients with AKT1 E17K-mutant tumors (n = 52) and a median of 5 lines of prior therapy, the median PFS was 5.5 months , 6.6 months and 4.2 months in patients with ER+ breast, gynecologic, and other solid tumors, respectively. In an exploratory biomarker analysis, imbalance of the AKT1 E17K-mutant allele, most frequently caused by copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity targeting the wild-type allele, was associated with longer PFS as was the presence of coincident PI3K pathway hotspot mutations. Persistent declines in AKT1 E17K in cfDNA were associated with improved PFS and response.
